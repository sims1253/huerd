Description: Generates color palettes using minimax optimization to maximize the
    minimum perceptual distance between colors. Features the ability to define
    fixed colors that are kept throughout the optimization process and a diagnostic
    dashboard. All optimization performed in the perceptually uniform OKLAB 
    color space with integrated color vision deficiency analysis.
