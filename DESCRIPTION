Title: Color Palette Optimization with fixed colors
Version: 0.4.0
Authors@R: 
    person("Maximilian", "Scholz", , "dev.scholz@mailbox.org", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Generates color palettes using minimax optimization to
    maximize the minimum perceptual distance between colors. Features the
    ability to define fixed colors that are kept throughout the
    optimization process, multiple optimization algorithms (COBYLA, SANN,
    DIRECT, Nelder-Mead), multi-objective optimization framework, full
    reproducibility support with metadata storage, and a diagnostic
    dashboard. All optimization performed in the perceptually uniform
    OKLAB color space with integrated color vision deficiency analysis.
