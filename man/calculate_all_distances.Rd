\title{Calculate Color Distances for Original and Color Vision Deficiency (CVD) Simulations}
\usage{
calculate_all_distances(points)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{A matrix or data frame of LAB color values, where each row represents
a color and columns represent L, A, and B values respectively.}
}
\value{
A list containing four vectors of color distances:
\item{original}{Distances between original color pairs}
\item{deutan}{Distances between color pairs as perceived by individuals with deuteranomaly}
\item{protan}{Distances between color pairs as perceived by individuals with protanomaly}
\item{tritan}{Distances between color pairs as perceived by individuals with tritanomaly}
Each vector contains the upper triangular part of the distance matrix.
}
\description{
This function calculates color distances between pairs of colors in the original
color space and in simulated color vision deficiency (CVD) spaces for deuteranomaly,
protanomaly, and tritanomaly.
