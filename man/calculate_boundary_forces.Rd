\title{Calculate boundary forces for a color point in LAB space}
\usage{
calculate_boundary_forces(point, boundary_force, boundaries)
}
\arguments{
\item{point}{A numeric vector of length 3 representing a single point in LAB
space, where the elements correspond to L, a, and b values
respectively.}

\item{boundary_force}{A numeric value representing the strength of the
boundary force. Higher values result in stronger
repulsion near boundaries.}

\item{boundaries}{A list containing the LAB space boundaries, with elements
'l', 'a', and 'b', each a numeric vector of length 2
specifying the min and max values. The 'a' boundaries are
used for both a and b channels.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 3 representing the boundary forces in the
l, a, and b dimensions. Positive values push the point away from the
lower boundary, while negative values push it away from the upper
boundary.
}
\description{
This function computes forces that keep colors within valid LAB space
boundaries. It calculates repulsive forces near the boundaries to prevent
colors from moving outside the valid range.
