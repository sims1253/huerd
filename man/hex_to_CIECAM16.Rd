\title{Convert Hex Color to CIECAM16 Color Appearance Correlates}
\usage{
hex_to_CIECAM16(
  hex,
  XYZ_w = c(95.05, 100, 108.88),
  L_A = 318.31,
  Y_b = 20,
  surround = ciecam_environs("Average"),
  discount_illuminant = FALSE,
  compute_H = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{hex}{Character string representing a hex color code (e.g., "#FF0000").
Must include the leading "#" and be 7 characters long.}

\item{XYZ_w}{Numeric vector of length 3 containing the reference white point
XYZ values. Default is D65 white point \link{95.05, 100.00, 108.88}.}

\item{L_A}{Numeric. The adapting field luminance in cd/mÂ².
Default is 318.31 (typical office lighting).}

\item{Y_b}{Numeric. The relative luminance of background.
Default is 20.0 (typical background).}

\item{surround}{List of viewing condition parameters. Default is "Average".}

\item{discount_illuminant}{Logical for complete adaptation. Default is FALSE.}

\item{compute_H}{Logical to include hue quadrature. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list containing CIECAM16 correlates (see \code{XYZ_to_CIECAM16()}).
}
\description{
Converts a hex color code to CIECAM16 color appearance correlates under
specified viewing conditions. This is a convenience function that combines
sRGB-to-XYZ and XYZ-to-CIECAM16 transformations.
}
\examples{
# Convert pure red
red_cam <- hex_to_CIECAM16("#FF0000")

# Convert white under dim conditions
white_dim <- hex_to_CIECAM16("#FFFFFF",
  surround = ciecam_environs("Dim")
)
