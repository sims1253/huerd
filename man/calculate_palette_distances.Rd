\title{Calculate Color Distances for a Palette}
\usage{
calculate_palette_distances(colors)
}
\arguments{
\item{colors}{A vector of color names or hex codes representing the palette.}
}
\value{
A list containing four vectors of color distances:
\item{original}{Distances between original color pairs}
\item{deutan}{Distances between color pairs as perceived by individuals with deuteranomaly}
\item{protan}{Distances between color pairs as perceived by individuals with protanomaly}
\item{tritan}{Distances between color pairs as perceived by individuals with tritanomaly}
Each vector contains the upper triangular part of the distance matrix.
}
\description{
This function calculates color distances between pairs of colors in a given palette,
both in the original color space and in simulated color vision deficiency (CVD) spaces.
