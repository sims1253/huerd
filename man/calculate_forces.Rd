\title{Calculate repulsive forces between colors}
\usage{
calculate_forces(points, n_base, n_colors, boundary_force, boundaries)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{A matrix of LAB coordinates where each row represents a color
and columns represent L, A, and B values respectively.}

\item{n_base}{An integer specifying the number of fixed base colors that
should not be moved.}

\item{n_colors}{An integer specifying the total number of colors, including
both base and non-base colors.}

\item{boundary_force}{A numeric value representing the strength of the
boundary forces that keep colors within the valid LAB
space.}

\item{boundaries}{A list containing the LAB space boundaries, typically with
elements 'L', 'a', and 'b', each a vector of length 2
specifying the min and max values.}
}
\value{
A matrix of force vectors with dimensions n_colors x 3, where each
row represents the force acting on a color in the L, A, and B
dimensions.
}
\description{
This function computes forces that push colors apart in LAB space. It
calculates color-to-color repulsion, boundary forces, and saturation forces
for each color point, excluding the fixed base colors.
