  points,
  base_colors,
  boundaries,
  learning_rate,
  boundary_force,
  iteration = 1,
  max_iterations = 200,

}
\arguments{
\item{points}{A matrix of LAB coordinates where each row represents a color,
and columns represent the L, a, and b values respectively.}

\item{base_colors}{An optional vector of hex color codes (e.g., "#FF0000")
representing fixed base colors that should not be moved.
Default is NULL.}

\item{boundaries}{A list containing the LAB space boundaries, with elements
'l', 'a', and 'b', each a numeric vector of length 2
specifying the min and max values for the respective
channels.}

\item{learning_rate}{A numeric value representing the learning rate for
updates. It controls the magnitude of position changes
per iteration.}

\item{boundary_force}{A numeric value representing the strength of the
boundary forces that keep colors within the valid LAB
space.}

\item{iteration}{The current iteration number.}

\item{max_iterations}{The total number of iterations.}

\item{target_distance}{The target distance for color separation.}

\item{distance_scale}{The scale factor for distance calculations.}

\item{min_lr_factor}{The minimum learning rate factor.}

\item{min_distance_boost}{The minimum distance boost.}
}
\value{
A matrix of updated LAB coordinates with the same dimensions as the
input points' matrix. Each row represents a color, and the columns
represent the updated L, a, and b values.
}
\description{
This function applies calculated forces to update the positions of colors
in LAB space. It adjusts the positions based on the forces acting on each
color, while respecting the boundaries of the LAB color space and any fixed
base colors.
