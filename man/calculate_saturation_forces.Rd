\title{Calculate Saturation Forces for a Color Point in LAB Space}
\usage{
calculate_saturation_forces(point, min_saturation = 30, force_magnitude = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{point}{A numeric vector of length 3 representing a single point in LAB
space, where the elements correspond to L, a, and b values
respectively.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 2 representing the saturation forces in
the a and b dimensions of LAB space. Positive values push the color
outward (increasing saturation), while negative values pull it
inward (decreasing saturation).
}
\description{
This function computes forces that maintain minimum color saturation in LAB
color space. It calculates a force vector that pushes under-saturated colors
outward, pulls over-saturated colors inward, and applies a small force to
maintain position for colors within the desired saturation range.
}
\details{
The function uses predefined minimum (30) and maximum (80) desired
saturation values. It calculates the distance from the neutral axis
and applies forces based on this distance relative to the desired
saturation range.
