# huerd 0.1.1 (2025-07-01)

## Minor Changes
*   Removed unused cli and crayon dependencies. 

# huerd 0.1.0 (2025-07-01)

This is a major refactoring and simplification of `huerd`, focusing the package on a single, scientifically-grounded objective: pure minimax color palette generation.

## Major Changes

*   **Pure Minimax Optimization**: The core `generate_palette()` function has been streamlined to use a pure minimax objective, maximizing the minimum perceptual distance between colors in the OKLAB space. All complex multi-objective parameters (`optimize_for`, `balance_weights`, `aesthetic_penalty_weights_LC`) have been removed, simplifying the API and aligning the package with a clear, defensible scientific goal.
*   **Comprehensive Diagnostic Dashboard**: A new `plot_palette_analysis()` function has been added. It provides a comprehensive, six-panel diagnostic dashboard inspired by `scicomap` for in-depth palette analysis. This feature uses only **base R graphics** and introduces zero new dependencies.
*   **Automatic Brightness Sorting**: All palettes generated by `generate_palette()` are now automatically sorted by their OKLAB lightness value, ensuring intuitive and consistent ordering from darkest to lightest.
*   **Simplified Evaluation**: The `evaluate_palette()` function is now a pure data provider, returning raw, objective metrics (distances, CVD safety, color distribution) without any subjective heuristic scoring.

## Minor Changes

*   The `is_cvd_safe()` function now uses the more robust `evaluate_palette()` function for its calculations.
*   The print methods for `huerd_palette` and `huerd_evaluation` have been updated to reflect the new, simplified data structures.

## Removals

The following experimental and non-essential features have been removed to streamline the package:

*   Force-field and repulsion-based optimization algorithms.
*   Palette animation framework.
*   Algorithm comparison tools.
*   Post-hoc CVD refinement steps.
*   3D color space visualizations.
*   All functionality related to the CAM16 and CIECAM16 color models.
