# huerd 0.5.0 (2025-07-07)

## New Features

### Smooth Optimization Support
- Added L-BFGS optimizer for gradient-based optimization
- Implemented two smooth objective functions: `smooth_repulsion` and `smooth_logsumexp`
- Added analytical gradient computation for faster convergence
- Speed improvements of 5-20x for larger palettes (8+ colors)

### Multi-Objective Framework Updates
- Extended framework to support smooth and discrete objectives
- Support for weighted combinations of smooth objectives

## API Changes
- Added `optimizer = "nlopt_lbfgs"` option for L-BFGS optimization
- Added `weights = c(smooth_repulsion = 1)` and `weights = c(smooth_logsumexp = 1)` for smooth objectives

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed critical bug where L-BFGS optimizer always used `smooth_repulsion` objective regardless of `weights` parameter
- Fixed crash in `evaluate_palette_quality()` when called directly with hex colors ("argument is of length zero" error)
- Both smooth objectives (`smooth_repulsion` and `smooth_logsumexp`) now work correctly and produce different optimization results

## Internal Changes
- Added analytical gradient functions for smooth objectives
- Extended multi-objective framework to handle smooth and discrete objectives
- Improved input validation in `evaluate_palette_quality()` function

# huerd 0.4.2 (2025-07-07)

## New Features

- Added L-BFGS optimizer (`optimizer = "nlopt_lbfgs"`) for gradient-based optimization
- Added support for smooth optimization using analytical gradients

## Internal Changes

- Added `optimize_colors_lbfgs()` function using `NLOPT_LD_LBFGS` algorithm

# huerd 0.4.1 (2025-07-07)

## Internal Changes

- Added smooth differentiable objective functions for future gradient-based optimization

---

# huerd 0.4.0 (2025-07-06)

## Major Changes

- Replaced base R graphics with grid graphics system. `plot_palette_analysis()` now uses `gridExtra::arrangeGrob()` for layout.

- Converted all plotting functions to return grob objects instead of drawing directly.

## New Features

- Added reproducibility system for palette generation with metadata storage.

- Added hue order reversal detection for CVD analysis.

## Breaking Changes

- Removed `new_device`, `device_width`, and `device_height` parameters from `plot_palette_analysis()`.

- Moved `gridExtra` from Suggests to Imports, added `grid` to Imports.

- Removed helper functions: `.create_graphics_device`, `.is_ragg_available`, `.is_interactive_ide`, `calculate_safe_margins`.


# huerd 0.3.1 (2025-07-04)

## New Features

- Added automated font size scaling to `plot_palette_analysis()` that automatically adjusts text sizes based on device dimensions.

# huerd 0.3.0 (2025-07-04)

## Major Changes

- Multi-optimizer framework: The `generate_palette()` function now supports four different optimization algorithms through the new `optimizer` parameter:
  - `"nloptr_cobyla"` (default): Deterministic optimization with constraint handling
  - `"sann"`: Stochastic simulated annealing
  - `"nlopt_direct"`: Deterministic global optimization using DIRECT algorithm
  - `"nlopt_neldermead"`: Derivative-free local optimization using Nelder-Mead simplex

- Added automatic font scaling to `plot_palette_analysis()` that prevents text overlap and out-of-frame issues.

## Minor Changes

- Added internal utility functions `.hex_to_oklab()` and `.oklab_to_hex()` to eliminate repetitive color conversion patterns.

- Fixed failing visualization tests and added test coverage for new utility functions.

- Updated test files to use utility functions.

# huerd 0.1.1 (2025-07-01)

## Minor Changes

- Removed unused cli and crayon dependencies.

# huerd 0.1.0 (2025-07-01)

This is a major refactoring and simplification of `huerd`, focusing the package on a single, scientifically-grounded objective: pure minimax color palette generation.

## Major Changes

- Pure minimax optimization: The core `generate_palette()` function has been streamlined to use a pure minimax objective, maximizing the minimum perceptual distance between colors in the OKLAB space. All complex multi-objective parameters (`optimize_for`, `balance_weights`, `aesthetic_penalty_weights_LC`) have been removed, simplifying the API and aligning the package with a clear, defensible scientific goal.

- Comprehensive diagnostic dashboard: A new `plot_palette_analysis()` function has been added. It provides a comprehensive, six-panel diagnostic dashboard inspired by `scicomap` for in-depth palette analysis. This feature uses only base R graphics and introduces zero new dependencies.

- Automatic brightness sorting: All palettes generated by `generate_palette()` are now automatically sorted by their OKLAB lightness value, ensuring intuitive and consistent ordering from darkest to lightest.

- Simplified evaluation: The `evaluate_palette()` function is now a pure data provider, returning raw, objective metrics (distances, CVD safety, color distribution) without any subjective heuristic scoring.

## Minor Changes

- The `is_cvd_safe()` function now uses the more robust `evaluate_palette()` function for its calculations.
- The print methods for `huerd_palette` and `huerd_evaluation` have been updated to reflect the new, simplified data structures.

## Removals

The following experimental and non-essential features have been removed to streamline the package:

- Force-field and repulsion-based optimization algorithms.
- Palette animation framework.
- Algorithm comparison tools.
- Post-hoc CVD refinement steps.
- 3D color space visualizations.
- All functionality related to the CAM16 and CIECAM16 color models.
