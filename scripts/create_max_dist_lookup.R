## code to prepare `MAX_MIN_DIST_ESTIMATES` dataset goes here

# This script is for the package developer. It is run once to create
# R/sysdata.rda, which contains the MAX_MIN_DIST_ESTIMATES lookup table.
# This object is then available internally to all package functions.
#
# This process can be time-consuming (minutes to hours depending on parameters).

# Make sure devtools/usethis are installed for the final step.
# And your package's dependencies (farver) are available.
# It's best to run this after loading your package functions, e.g., with devtools::load_all()
